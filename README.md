## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- TailwindCss

### What I learned

This was the first time to deal with date and time in javascript , it was a good exercise to practice with concepts i learned . I also became more familiar with DOM manipulation .

### Continued development

I want to deal with animation more as I've not played around with it quite often . Also create more stuff related to date & time , DOM , and tailwindcss.
